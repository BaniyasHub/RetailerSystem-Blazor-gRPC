Deadline Behaviors
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a deadline is exceeded, the client and service have different behavior:


**Client
---------------------------------------------------
The client immediately aborts the underlying HTTP request and throws a DeadlineExceeded error.
The client app can choose to catch the error and display a timeout message to the user.


**Server
---------------------------------------------------
On the server, the executing HTTP request is aborted and ServerCallContext.CancellationToken is raised.
Although the HTTP request is aborted, the gRPC call continues to run on the server until the method completes.
It's important that the cancellation token is passed to async methods so they are cancelled along with the call.
For example, passing a cancellation token to async database queries and HTTP requests.
Passing a cancellation token allows the canceled call to complete quickly on the server and free up resources for other calls.


**Retries
---------------------------------------------------
When a gRPC call is configured with retry fault handling and a deadline, the deadline tracks time across all retries for a gRPC call.
If the deadline is exceeded, a gRPC call immediately aborts the underlying HTTP request, skips any remaining retries, and throws a DeadlineExceeded error.


**Propagating 
---------------------------------------------------
We must propagate the deadline and cancellation tokens when we are using GrpcClient in an GrpcServer
EnableCallContextPropagation() method when registering GrpcClient in IOC enable us to propagate
Doesn't propagate the deadline if the child call specifies a smaller deadline.
For example, a propogated deadline of 10 seconds isn't used if a child call specifies a new deadline of 5 seconds using CallOptions.Deadline.
When multiple deadlines are available, the smallest deadline is used.
