A component's name must start with an uppercase character.


Directives: Change the way component markup is parsed or functions. 
	For example, the @page directive specifies a routable component with a route template and can be reached directly by a user's request in the browser at a specific URL.

Directive attributes: Change the way a component element is parsed or functions. For example, the @bind directive attribute for an <input> element binds data to the element's value.


The @inherits directive is used to specify a base class for a component.
This enables a component can inherit a base class to provide the component's properties and methods.


Providing initial values for component parameters is supported, but don't create a component that writes to its own parameters after the component is rendered for the first time.

Component parameters should be declared as auto-properties, meaning that they shouldn't contain custom logic in their get or set accessors. 

Writing an initial value to a component parameter is supported because initial value assignments don't interfere with the Blazor's automatic component rendering. 

Apply the [EditorRequired] attribute to specify a required component parameter. If a parameter value isn't provided, editors or build tools may display warnings to the user. 

The property receiving the RenderFragment content must be named ChildContent by convention.

Event callbacks aren't supported for RenderFragment.
