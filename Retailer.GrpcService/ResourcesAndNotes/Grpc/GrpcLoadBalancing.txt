Client-side load balancing is a feature that allows gRPC clients to distribute load optimally across available servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Client-side load balancing is configured when a channel is created. The two components to consider when using load balancing:

The resolver, which resolves the addresses for the channel. Resolvers support getting addresses from an external source. This is also known as service discovery.
The load balancer, which creates connections and picks the address that a gRPC call will use.

Built-in implementations of resolvers and load balancers are included in Grpc.Net.Client. Load balancing can also be extended by writing custom resolvers and load balancers.
Addresses, connections and other load balancing state is stored in a GrpcChannel instance. A channel must be reused when making gRPC calls for load balancing to work correctly.
