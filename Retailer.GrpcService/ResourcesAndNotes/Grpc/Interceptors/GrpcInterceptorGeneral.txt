Interceptors are a gRPC concept that allows apps to interact with incoming or outgoing gRPC calls. They offer a way to enrich the request processing pipeline.
Interceptors are configured for a channel or service and executed automatically for each gRPC call.
Since interceptors are transparent to the user's application logic, they're an excellent solution for common cases, such as logging, monitoring, authentication, and validation.
----
By default, the Interceptor base class doesn't do anything. Add behavior to an interceptor by overriding the appropriate base class methods in an interceptor implementation.

gRPC Interceptors versus Middleware
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASP.NET Core middleware offers similar functionalities compared to interceptors in C-core-based gRPC apps. ASP.NET Core middleware and interceptors are conceptually similar. 

gRPC Interceptor similarities with ASP.NET Core Middleware:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Are used to construct a pipeline that handles a gRPC request.
Allow work to be performed before or after the next component in the pipeline.
Provide access to HttpContext:
In middleware, the HttpContext is a parameter.
In interceptors, the HttpContext can be accessed using the ServerCallContext parameter with the ServerCallContext.GetHttpContext extension method.
This feature is specific to interceptors running in ASP.NET Core.

gRPC Interceptor differences from ASP.NET Core Middleware:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Interceptors:
----------------
Operate on the gRPC layer of abstraction using the ServerCallContext.
Provide access to:
The deserialized message sent to a call.
The message returned from the call before it's serialized.
Can catch and handle exceptions thrown from gRPC services.

Middleware:
-----------------
Runs for all HTTP requests.
Runs before gRPC interceptors.
Operates on the underlying HTTP/2 messages.
Can only access bytes from the request and response streams.
