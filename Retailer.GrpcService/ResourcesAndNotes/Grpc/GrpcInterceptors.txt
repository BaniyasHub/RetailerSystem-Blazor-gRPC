Interceptors are a gRPC concept that allows apps to interact with incoming or outgoing gRPC calls. They offer a way to enrich the request processing pipeline.
Interceptors are configured for a channel or service and executed automatically for each gRPC call.
Since interceptors are transparent to the user's application logic, they're an excellent solution for common cases, such as logging, monitoring, authentication, and validation.
----
By default, the Interceptor base class doesn't do anything. Add behavior to an interceptor by overriding the appropriate base class methods in an interceptor implementation.
